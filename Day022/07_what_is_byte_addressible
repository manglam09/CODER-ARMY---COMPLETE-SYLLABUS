Byte addressable means that each unique memory address in the system refers to exactly one byte (8 bits) of data.

Explanation:

In most modern computer architectures, memory is byte addressable.

This means if you have 1 GB of RAM, then you have 
2
30
2
30
 different addresses, each pointing to a single byte (8 bits).

For example:

Address 1000 → stores 1 byte (say 10101100)

Address 1001 → next byte

Address 1002 → next byte, and so on.

If the CPU needs a larger data type (like int = 4 bytes), it accesses 4 consecutive byte addresses.
E.g., if an int starts at address 2000, it occupies addresses 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003.
